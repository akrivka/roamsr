> Don't want to use an extra app for [[spaced repetition]]? \
> roam/sr lets you do everything in Roam natively! \
> You can try SR now! ([Remember to write good prompts.](https://andymatuschak.org/prompts))

`roam/sr` adds UI elements and logic for tagging and reviewing blocks as q/a or cloze flashcards in [Roam Research](roamresearch.com), with spaced repetition using a simplified Anki algorithm.
